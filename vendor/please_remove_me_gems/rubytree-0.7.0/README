== DESCRIPTION:

RubyTree is a Ruby implementation of the generic tree data structure.  It provides a node-based model to store keyed
node-elements in the tree and simple APIs to access, modify and traverse the structure.  RubyTree is node-centric, where
individual nodes on the tree are the primary compositional and structural elements.

This implementation also mixes in the Enumerable module to allow standard access to the tree as a collection.

== SYNOPSIS:

As an example, the following code-snippet implements this tree structure:

                 +------------+
                 |    ROOT    |
                 +-----+------+
         +-------------+------------+
         |                          |
 +-------+-------+          +-------+-------+
 |  CHILD 1      |          |  CHILD 2      |
 +-------+-------+          +---------------+
         |
         |
 +-------+-------+
 | GRANDCHILD 1  |
 +---------------+

 # ..... Example starts.
 require 'tree'                 # Load the library

 # ..... Create the root node first.  Note that every node has a name and an optional content payload.
 root_node = Tree::TreeNode.new("ROOT", "Root Content")

 # ..... Now insert the child nodes.  Note that you can "chain" the child insertions for a given path to any depth.
 root_node << Tree::TreeNode.new("CHILD1", "Child1 Content") << Tree::TreeNode.new("GRANDCHILD1", "GrandChild1 Content")
 root_node << Tree::TreeNode.new("CHILD2", "Child2 Content")

 # ..... Lets print the representation to stdout.  This is primarily used for debugging purposes.
 root_node.printTree

 # ..... Lets directly access children and grandchildren of the root.  The can be "chained" for a given path to any depth.
 child1 = root_node["CHILD1"]
 grand_child1 = root_node["CHILD1"]["GRANDCHILD1"]

 # ..... Lets retrieve siblings of the current node as an array.
 siblings_of_child1 = child1.siblings

 # ..... Lets retrieve immediate children of the root node as an array.
 children_of_root = root_node.children

 # ..... This is a depth-first and L-to-R pre-ordered traversal.
 root_node.each { |node| node.content.reverse }

 # ..... Lets remove a child node from the root node.
 root_node.remove!(child1)


== REQUIREMENTS:

* Ruby 1.8+  (http://www.ruby-lang.org)

* Optional but recommended:
  * structured_warnings (http://github.com/schmidt/structured_warnings) Rubygem
  * Yard (http://yardoc.org) Rubygem for the documentation
  * JSON (http://flori.github.com/json) Rubygem for converting to/from the JSON format

* Development dependencies (not required for installing the gem):
  * Hoe (http://seattlerb.rubyforge.org/hoe/Hoe.html) Rubygem
  * gemcutter (http://gemcutter.org/gems/gemcutter) Rubygem
  * Rubyforge (http://codeforpeople.rubyforge.org/rubyforge) Rubygem

== INSTALL:

RubyTree is an open source project and is hosted at:

http://rubytree.rubyforge.org

RubyTree can be downloaded as a Rubygem or as a tar/zip file from:

http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1215&release_id=8817

The file-name is one of:

    rubytree-<VERSION>.gem - The Rubygem
    rubytree-<VERSION>.tgz - GZipped source files
    rubytree-<VERSION>.zip - Zipped  source files

Download the appropriate file-type for your system.

It is recommended to install RubyTree as a Ruby Gem, as this is an easy way to keep the version updated, and keep
multiple versions of the library available on your system.

=== Installing the Gem

To Install the Gem, from a Terminal/CLI command prompt, issue the command:

  $ gem install rubytree

This should install the gem file for RubyTree. Note that you may need to be a super-user (root) to successfully install
the gem.

=== Installing from the tgz/zip file

Extract the archive file (tgz or zip) and run the following command from the top-level source directory:

    ruby ./setup.rb

You may need administrator/super-user privileges to complete the setup using this method.

== DOCUMENTATION:

The primary class for this implementation is Tree::TreeNode. See the class documentation for an usage example.

From a command line/terminal prompt, you can issue the following command to view the text mode ri documentation:

    ri Tree::TreeNode

Documentation for the latest released version is available at:

http://rubytree.rubyforge.org/rdoc

Documentation for the latest git HEAD is available at:

http://rdoc.info/projects/evolve75/RubyTree

Note that the documentation is formatted for Yard (http://yardoc.org).

== DEVELOPERS:

You can download the latest released source code using the tar or zip version as mentioned above in the installation
section.

Alternatively, you can checkout the latest commit/revision from the version control system.  Note that RubyTree's
primary SCM[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Management] is on git[http://git-scm.com] and is
also mirrored on github[http://www.github.com].

=== Using the Git repository

For checking out from the primary Git repository, use the following command:

  $ git clone git://rubyforge.org/rubytree.git

The Git repository is available for browsing on the web at: http://fisheye2.atlassian.com/browse/rubytree

=== Using the Git repository on http://github.com

For cloning the git repository, use one of the following commands:

  $ git clone git://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree.git

or
  $ git clone http://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree.git

The git repository is available on the web at: http://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree

=== Setting up the development environment

After checking out the source, run:

  $ rake newb

This task will install any missing dependencies, run the tests/specs, and generate the RDoc.

Note that you need to have the Rubygem Hoe[http://seattlerb.rubyforge.org/hoe/Hoe.html] to successfully run the rake
tasks.  Installing Hoe may also install additional pre-requisite gems.  See the REQUIREMENTS section in this document for
details.

For generating the documentation, it is strongly suggested that the Yard[http://yardoc.org] gem be installed.
