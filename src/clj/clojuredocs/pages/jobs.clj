            "Amperity is a stealth-mode enterprise software company founded by repeat entrepreneurs Kabir Shahani and Derek Slager. After a successful exit of their prior venture in 2013, the two are back at it again to address one of the largest unmet needs in the marketing technology space, and are building a powerhouse team to do so.

Through the use of functional programming, modern big data tools, and a machine learning- powered data stitching platform, our team of talented engineers and trusted advisors are building a one-of-a-kind data-first application for marketing.

Amperity is backed by some of the most notable names in tech -- including Madrona Venture Group, Liquid 2 Ventures, Hyde Park Ventures, and top executives and founders from multi-billion dollar companies like Concur, ExactTarget, Microsoft, and Isilon Systems. Full press release.

If you thrive on solving difficult problems, have a desire to push yourself to the limits, and want to have fun in the process, then we would love to have a chat with you about joining our team.



# Technologies We Use

* Clojure for back end services
* ClojureScript for our front end, a reactive SPA
* Big data tools, including Mesos, Spark, Kafka and Accumulo
* Modern provisioning infrastructure, including Apache Aurora and SaltStack


# Interesting Problems

* Our system involves ingestion of very large amounts of data, and blending this processing with real-time events
* We automatically stitch data together across disparate systems, and improve this process in generalized ways
* We allow users to perform complex, real-time queries across aggregated datasets


# About You

* You are excited about using Clojure in a production environment, and have experience with Clojure or other functional languages
* Experience building JVM oriented production systems
* Experience working with large-scale data oriented systems
* Your ears perk up when somebody says “graph traversal”
* Open minded, inclusive, and motivated to make good decisions


# Benefits

We offer all the benefits you’d expect from a “great place to work”. Transportation subsidies, 100% healthcare coverage, and a comfortable snack-laden work environment. We’ve got all that superficial stuff, and more. All that is great, but Amperity provides benefits that are hard to find: a place where you’ll be proud to call your colleagues “friends”, for real. An environment where you’ll be challenged to find and unlock your full potential. The opportunity to make a lifetime’s worth of memories building a world-class company with world-class people.

Adzerk engineers are responsible for working on all parts of the system. This includes the front-end web application, back-end services, and the ad delivery engines. Our platform is built using Node.js with Coffeescript, Clojure, Mono, JQuery, MongoDB, and Hadoop, with a whole lot of AWS and Chef. We’re currently serving over 25,000 req/sec (and growing fast), so you’ll get to work on some real scalability challenges.

Performance and scalability are our two primary concerns, and with the traffic and growth rates that we’re experiencing, lots of the lessons that you’ve learned start to break down. Because of that, it’s not as important what you know right now – what matters is how quickly you can learn and adapt.

Things you should be interested in -- or even better, have experience with:

* Clojure
* Large-scale distributed systems
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Bonus points for startup experience!
* Things you should know about us:

We have an engineering-driven culture, and our CEO is a software developer. We have no professional managers — everyone contributes.

Your work will have an immediate and profound impact on our product and business.

We ship code dozens of times a week.

You will have the freedom and responsibility for choosing what tools and libraries we use.

We use the open source model internally to manage our work. We submit pull requests, and other engineers review them before merging.

We prize open source, and do our best to contribute back to the community.

Everyone gets equity. We want a team of partners.

We all have unlimited vacation. We work hard, but at a sustainable pace.

We’re creating an innovative advertising platform that is shaking up the ecommerce industry with a combination of fresh thinking and exceptional technology. As a growth-stage business, we’re looking for people to help us scale, tackle new challenges and create a whole new kind of company."
            :job-description "# Intent Media isn’t your usual company.

Our work is powered by the premise that every person at Intent Media is unique, possessing a distinct set of skills, personality and passions.  We embrace our collective talents to tackle technical challenges, refine our successfully disruptive business ideas and co-create one of the most human and inspiring work cultures out there. We are a team of deep collaborators, valuing and rewarding shared success over individual heroics.

As a Software Creator at Intent Media you’ll code and innovate on products that are changing the ecommerce industry. Our engineering teams help the world’s leading travel companies to serve tens of millions of ads every day across the United States and around the world. These ads provide an exceptional user experience to help shoppers find and compare prices, while simultaneously increasing brand profitability.

Our polyglot approach means you will see a variety of backend languages, Javascript libraries, and databases. Our agile way of working is founded on many years of experience; you will be working with accomplished innovators in the software community.


# What you will do

We believe that engineers are most effective when they are involved with the whole lifecycle of software development: conceiving new features, designing and coding the change, testing, deploying, and support. You’ll be performing all these activities as part of a closely collaborating squad. Don’t worry if you don’t know how to do everything at first - you’ll learn the essentials through pair programming with experienced engineers on your team.


# About you

* You have experience with at least one common object-oriented language (Java, Ruby, etc.)
* You have experience with databases and SQL.
* You have experience with, or interest in, functional programming - several of our teams are using languages like Clojure and Scala, and modern Java also has functional idioms.
* You posses a solid grounding in computer science including algorithms and data structures.
* You have the flexibility to work on all aspects of delivering working software, including analysis, design, automated testing, cross team collaboration, and support.
* And you have a solid understanding of, and ideally experience with, web application development.
